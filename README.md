- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project folder.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open the project folder in your code editor.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser, or use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code for live reloading.

### Folder Structure

```
project-root/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file
